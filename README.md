<h1>Installing software in a Linux Distribution</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I used the echo command to explore how input is received and how output is returned in the shell. I also experimented with other Linux commands in the Bash shell to delve deeper into input and output processes, along with other basic shell functions.
