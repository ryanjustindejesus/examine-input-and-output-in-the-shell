<h1>Examining input and output in the shell</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I used the echo command to explore how input is received and how output is returned in the shell. I also experimented with other Linux commands in the Bash shell to delve deeper into input and output processes, along with other basic shell functions.
<br />


<h2>Completed Tasks in this Lab</h2>

- <b>Generating output in the shell with the echo command</b> 
- <b>Performing basic calculations with the expr command</b>
- <b>Clearing the shell window with the clear command</b> 
- <b>Exploring the commands further</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Qwiklabs</b>
